# Invoice Inc.

This repository contains a small React prototype for an invoice simulation. The game logic lives in `src/core` and `src/modules`, while the React UI is found under `src/ui`.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and build the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. You will see a start screen that leads to an invoice form and feedback panel.
